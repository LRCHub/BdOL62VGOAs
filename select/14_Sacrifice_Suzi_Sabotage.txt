Color me with your bruises
Decorate me with your scars
Give me all your misery
Take it all out on me

Sacrifice me
At the altar of your agony
And adorn me
With the crosses you carry

Illuminated in the night
Pinned down by your searchlight
Another target in your sight
In the dark, gleaming bright

Sacrifice me
At the altar of your agony
And adorn me
With the crosses you carry

I don't even have a name
I'm just a canvas for your pain
It will always be the same
I'm just a canvas for your pain

Sacrifice me
At the altar of your agony
And adorn me
With the crosses you carry

[00:07.11] I was born in a city
[00:11.26] Where the winter nights don't ever sleep
[00:14.75] So this life's always with me
[00:19.06] The ice inside my veins will never bleed
[00:39.06] 
[00:30.22] Uh, every time you try to fix me
[00:34.56] I know you'll never find that missing piece
[00:38.23] When you cry and say you miss me
[00:42.72] I lie and tell you that I'll never leave, but
[01:05.22] 
[00:46.74] I sacrifice (sacrifice)
[00:49.60] Your love for more of the night (of the night)
[00:53.30] I try to put up a fight (up a fight)
[00:57.61] Can't tie me down (down)
[01:09.61] 
[01:01.22] I don't wanna sacrifice
[01:05.53] For your love, I try
[01:09.49] I don't wanna sacrifice
[01:13.48] But I love my time
[01:22.48] 
[01:25.87] I hold you through the toughest parts
[01:27.85] When you feel like it's the end
[01:29.80] 'Cause life is still worth living
[01:31.83] Yeah, this life is still worth living
[01:50.33] 
[01:33.74] I can break you down and pick you up
[01:35.86] And fuck like we are friends
[01:37.69] But don't be catching feelings
[01:39.58] Don't be out here catching feelings 'cause
[02:00.58] 
[01:41.80] I sacrifice (sacrifice)
[01:44.79] Your love for more of the night (of the night)
[01:48.56] I try to put up a fight (up a fight)
[01:52.44] Can't tie me down (down, down, down)
[02:10.44]
